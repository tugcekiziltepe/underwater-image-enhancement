    "Underwater imaging is critical for various applications, including marine biology and underwater exploration. However, underwater images often suffer from color distortion, contrast reduction, and detail loss due to the scattering and absorption of light by water. To address these challenges, various image enhancement techniques have been proposed, such as deep learning-based methods, physical models, and specific enhancement techniques. In this paper, we will perform a comparative analysis of these techniques using the widely used UIEB benchmark dataset. We evaluate their effectiveness in improving the visual quality of underwater images and provide insights into their limitations. We expect that deep learning-based methods generally outperform other techniques in terms of objective and subjective quality measures. However, physical models and specific enhancement techniques can still provide valuable improvements for certain types of images. This research can help researchers and practitioners choose appropriate methods for underwater image enhancement and inspire further developments in this field."

    "This is a CNN model trained by the UIEB dataset. A gated fusion network called Water-Net fuses the inputs and the predicted confidence maps to produce the improved outcome. The Feature Transformation Units (FTUs) first convert the inputs to the refined inputs before predicting the confidence maps. Finally, by combining the improved inputs and the corresponding confidence maps, the improved result is obtained.\n",

    "By individually applying White Balance (WB), Histogram Equalization (HE), and Gamma Correction (GC) algorithms to an underwater image, we produce three inputs. In particular, the WB algorithm is used to remove color casts, while the HE and GC algorithms work to boost contrast and brighten dark areas, respectively.\n"

    "## Traditional Image Processing Technique[3, 4]\n",
    "The approach used to enhance underwater images includes color correction, white balancing, contrast enhancement, unsharp masking, and fusion. First, the images are color corrected by compensating for the degradation of the red and blue channels, followed by white balancing using the Gray World algorithm. Then, the contrast of the color-corrected image is enhanced using global histogram equalization, and the image is sharpened using unsharp masking. Finally, two techniques are used for image fusion: averaging-based fusion and PCA-based fusion. The PCA-based fusion involves flattening the components of both images into a column vector, finding the mean, covariance matrix, and eigenvectors of the concatenated matrix, and obtaining the coefficients for each channel for both images to obtain the fused image.\n"
